## Description

The motivation behind building this project was to write good code that can be referenced in the future regarding jest tests. This project was built so I could have something to reference in the future for writing tests. This project takes user input and uses that to create an SVG file. The code is tested using jest tests. I learned a lot about the syntax of jest tests.
